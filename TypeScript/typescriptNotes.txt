JavaScript - Dynamically types language
let age = 30
let name = 'John'
age = 'thirty'

Typescript - Statically typed language
let age = 30 OR let age:number = 30
let name = 'John' OR let name:string = 'john'
age = 'thirty' #NOT ALLOWED

Why Typescript ?
- JavaScript (ES3, ES4, ES5, ES6)
- ECMAScript - ES is the standard to which all JavaScript code must comply.

TypeScript - Superset of JavaScript.
- A vendor can't add features to the JavaScript language without breaking ECMAScript compliance.
- In contrast,  with TypeScript, Microsoft can add any new feature it wants, so long as the generated JavaScript is ECMAScript-complaint.
- That Give Microsoft all the freedom in the world to make typescript as feature-full as any other programming language.

Setup -
- First install node.js
- install typescript (npm install -g typescript)
- Install VScode

Running TypeScript file-
- save file with .ts extension
- compile the file with "tsc .\TypeScript\script1.ts(file_path)". It will create the one .js file
- run program by using 'node .\TypeScript\Day1\script1.js(js file_path)'.

Another way to run TypeScript file (BETTER WAY):
- install tsx package (npm install -g tsx)
- run file with 'tsc .\TypeScript\script1.ts(file_path)'
